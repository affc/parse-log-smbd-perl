Parse-Log-Smbd

This module retrieves usernames successfully authenticated to a Samba smbd server, through parsing of a log.smbd file. 
Connections to network shares are also to be retrieved.

Hopefully, it should work on the usual Linux/Unix platforms where Samba itself runs. 
A simple check is done with Devel::CheckOS.
